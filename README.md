# hello-world
This is me, setting off on a big green project.
I'll be running requests against large datasets here, hoping to pull out some useful answers and questions about the big numbers in climate policy. Megawatt hours and kilowatt hours and millions of tonnes of CO2e (carbon dioxide equivalent, which factors in the harder, less long-lasting hit of methane against the much more common gas that causes most of the long-term damage; carbon dioxide, and some others).
